# SVG Logo Creator

This fun project uses packages such as inquirer to ask the user a series of questions in order to more easily generate a personally tailored logo for the user, stored in an SVG file.




## Installation

Install my-project with npm

```bash
  npm install //installing needed dependencies/packages
```
Run this command afterwards to begin creating your logo:
```bash
  node index //installing needed dependencies/packages
```
    
## Tests

Along with pre-made logo creation, my project also includes testing from a native js package named Jest. To run these tests, run the following command

```bash
  npm test
```
